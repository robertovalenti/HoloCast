# Reusable Module Template

This repository is meant to be a scaffolding starting point to build reusable holochain modules (zome & UI module).

This is what is has included:

- UI and Zome Instructions to use the module in a bigger app
- Github Actions automatic integration with building and testing
- Zome
  - Basic sample code 
  - Integrated tests with tryorama
  - Instructions to include the zome as a crate in any DNA
- UI
  - Reusable CustomElements with `lit-element`
  - Automated demoing with `storybook`, also publishing to `gh-pages`
  - Automated testing with `web-test-runner`
  - Automated end-to-end testing with the holochain zome
  - GraphQl common libraries and scaffold code
  - See [open-wc](https://open-wc.org/) for all the available tools and documentation

## How to scaffold a holochain reusable module

1. Create a new repository from this template (you can use the `Use this template` button on the top of this page).
2. Look for all the `TODO` keyword to see the places that need to be changed.
3. Remove this section of this README.md until this next line.

# TODO_RENAME_MODULE

> TODO: carefully change whatever needed in this README.

Small zome to create and see calendar events, in holochain RSM.

This module is designed to be included in other DNAs, assuming as little as possible from those. It is packaged as a holochain zome, and an npm package that offers native Web Components that can be used across browsers and frameworks.

## Documentation

See our [`storybook`](https://holochain-open-dev.github.io/calendar-events-zome).

## Assumptions

These are the things you need to know to decide if you can use this module in your happ:

- Zome:
  - Optional dependency with the [resource-bookings-zome](https://github/holochain-open-dev/resource-bookings-zome).
- UI module:
  - `ApolloClient` as the state-management and data-fetching engine.
  - The resolvers are declared in the frontend using [`makeExecutableSchema`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@graphql-tools/schema).
  - No framework or library assumed.

## Installation and usage

### Including the zome in your DNA

1. Create a new folder in the `zomes` of the consuming DNA, with the name you want to give to this zome in your DNA.
2. Add a new `Cargo.toml` in that folder. In its content, paste the `Cargo.toml` content from any zome.
3. Change the `name` properties of the `Cargo.toml` file to the name you want to give to this zome in your DNA.
4. Add this zome as a dependency in the `Cargo.toml` file:
```toml
[dependencies]
todo_rename_zome = {git = "TODO_CHANGE_MODULE_URL", package = "todo_rename_zome"}
```
5. Create a `src` folder besides the `Cargo.toml` with this content:
```rust
extern crate todo_rename_zome;
```
6. Add the zome into your `*.dna.workdir/dna.json` file.
7. Compile the DNA with the usual `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=target cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown`.

### Using the UI module

1. Install the module with `npm install @holochain-open-dev/calendar-events`.

OR

Add it in your `package.json` with a reference to `holochain-open-dev/TODO_RENAME_MODULE_REPOSITORY#ui-build`

2. Add the GraphQl schema and resolvers to your `ApolloClient` setup:

```js
import { AppWebsocket } from "@holochain/conductor-api";
import {
  calendarEventsTypeDefs,
  calendarEventsResolvers,
} from "@holochain-open-dev/calendar-events";

export async function setupClient(url) {
  const appWebsocket = await AppWebsocket.connect(String(url));

  const appInfo = await appWebsocket.appInfo({ app_id: "test-app" });

  const cellId = appInfo.cell_data[0][0];

  const executableSchema = makeExecutableSchema({
    typeDefs: [rootTypeDef, calendarEventsTypeDefs],
    resolvers: [calendarEventsResolvers(appWebsocket, cellId)],
  });

  const schemaLink = new SchemaLink({ schema: executableSchema });

  return new ApolloClient({
    typeDefs: allTypeDefs,
    cache: new InMemoryCache(),
    link: schemaLink,
  });
}
```

3. In the root file of your application, install the module:

```js
import { CalendarEventsModule } from "@holochain-open-dev/calendar-events";
async function initApp() {
  const client = await setupClient(`ws://localhost:8888`);

  const calendarEventsModule = new CalendarEventsModule(client);

  await calendarEventsModule.install();
}
```

4. Once you have installed the module, all the elements you see in our storybook will become available for you to use in your HTML, like this:

```html
...
<body>
  <hod-cal-full-calendar></hod-cal-full-calendar>
</body>
```

Take into account that at this point the elements already expect a holochain conductor running at `ws://localhost:8888`.

## Developer setup

This respository is structured in the following way:

- `ui/`: UI library.
- `zome/`: example DNA with the `todo_rename_zome` code.
- Top level `Cargo.toml` is a virtual package necessary for other DNAs to include this zome by pointing to this git repository.

Read the [UI developer setup](/ui/README.md) and the [Zome developer setup](/zome/README.md).
